Getting Started
===============

To use ASCI you will need to have performed an experiment at the Australian Synchrotron and
have an Australian Syncrotron Portal account. If you have forgotten your password you can
reset it at https://portal.synchrotron.org.au/.

To log in to ASCI, visit https://asci.synchrotron.org.au/. Once you have logged you will be
presented with a number of Environments to choose from. These are templates for creating your
computing desktop and define what software is available inside your desktop.
