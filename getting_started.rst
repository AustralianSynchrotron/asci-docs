Getting Started
===============

Gaining access to ASCI
----------------------

If you have performed an experiment on the XFM or IMBL beamlines after June, 2017 you will
automatically have access to ASCI. If you don't fall into this category please contact a
Beamline Scientist to request access.

To log in to ASCI:

1. Open https://asci.synchrotron.org.au/ with an up to date version of `Chrome
   <https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/>`_ or `Firefox
   <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/>`_.
2. Log in with your Australian Synchrotron Portal account.

If you have forgotten your password you can reset it at https://portal.synchrotron.org.au/.


Launching a session
-------------------

Once you have logged you will be presented with a number of Environments to choose from. These
are templates for creating your computing desktop and define what software is available inside
your desktop.

To launch a session simply click on an Environment according to the type of data you wish to process.

**Online vs offline**

If you are currently performing an experiment on the XFM or IMBL beamlines you will have
access to an "Online" environment. This environment will run on a dedicated compute node so
that you won't be competing for system resources with other users.
