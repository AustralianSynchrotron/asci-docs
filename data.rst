Managing your data
==================

Downloading
-----------

You can download your data from the Australian Synchrotron SFTP service.

1. Install and run an SFTP client such as `Filezilla <https://filezilla-project.org/>`_
   or `Cyberduck <https://cyberduck.io/>`_.
2. Configure your client with the following settings:

   | **Host / Server:** sftp.synchrotron.org.au
   | **Port:** 22
   | **Protocol:** SFTP
   | **Username:** *Your Portal email address*
   | **Password:** *Your Portal password*

3. When you connect you will be presented with a list of folders for each experiment you have
   attended. Any data you put under the experiment folders on ASCI will be accessible.


Uploading
---------

We currently do not support direct uploads to ASCI. However, from within an ASCI session you
can launch a browser and connect to file hosting services such as Dropbox or Google Drive.
Filezilla is also installed inside the ASCI environments and can be used for downloading data
from external file servers.
