Uploading
---------

We currently do not support direct uploads to ASCI. However, from within an ASCI session you
can launch a browser and connect to file hosting services such as Dropbox or Google Drive.
Filezilla is also installed inside the ASCI environments and can be used for downloading data
from external file servers.
