Downloading
-----------

You can download your data from the Australian Synchrotron SFTP service.

1. Install and run a SFTP client such as `Filezilla <https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1>`_,
   `Cyberduck <https://cyberduck.io/>`_ or `WinSCP <https://winscp.net/>`_.
2. Configure your client with the following settings:

   | **Host / Server:** sftp.synchrotron.org.au
   | **Port:** 22
   | **Protocol:** SFTP
   | **Username:** *Your Portal email address*
   | **Password:** *Your Portal password*

3. When you connect you will be presented with a list of folders for each experiment you have
   attended.

For example, the Filezilla configuration would look like:

To download files or folders, simply drag them from the right pane to the left pane. You can
see the progress of the transfer under "Queued files" at the bottom of the window.

**Note:** Data produced on ASCI will only be available for download if it has been saved in the
experiment folder.
